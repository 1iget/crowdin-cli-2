### Introduction
Crowdin CLI is a command line tool that allows you to manage and synchronize your localization resources with your Crowdin project:

- Automate the process of updating your source files in your Crowdin project

### Configuration

To use Crowdin CLI you need to have a configuration file. We recommend to name it _crowdin.yaml_. You can create it running the command:

```
$ crowdin generate
```

When calling Crowdin CLI in terminal you should be in your project root directory. Otherwise, you will have to specify a configuration file path using the `--config` option:
```
$ crowdin upload sources --config /path/to/your/config/file
```

Run `crowdin help` to get more details regarding other commands.

Sample configuration file:
```
"project_identifier" : "your-project-identifier"
"api_key" : "your-api-key"
"base_path" : "your-base-path"

"preserve_hierarchy": true

"files": [
  {
    "source" : "/t1/**/*",
    "translation" : "/%two_letters_code%/%original_file_name%"
  }
]
```
